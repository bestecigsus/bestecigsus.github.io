The market and the consumer have to make their evolution because in a pharmacy can not sell all the devices that are in the market, &quot;he points out. Throw the rest and leave one at home for me I would enter the monkey to the beast ... And I smoke it a short time (although when I went in the middle I look at it and turn it off). Every few months, a new study on the effects of smoking e-cigarettes concludes the opposite of what came before. This way they have the advantage of being removable, so you do not have to waste time cleaning by filling your new cartridge. Then I gradually lowered the amount of nicotine and within a few months I saw myself without nicotine (interestingly, the most expensive thing was to go from 6 mg to 3 mg, not 3 to 0 mg ...), then I spent some time ( Little, a few weeks) vapeando with 0 mg and until today, I threw the electronic cigarette and I do not remember the tobacco. If you work at concentrations above 48mg / ml (at this concentration we do not vaporize it but if we can find them when we do alchemy) it can be fatal, so call toxicological questions if it spills over you. You should also treat every residue as potentially dangerous, we do not want to poison the poor wretch who finds himself with a bottle at such high concentration. This product does not treat, diagnose or cure any type of illness, physical condition condition. We recommend you accompany your purchase with spare resistors and your favorite e-juice. Hajek P, Etter JF, Benowitz N, Eissenberg T, McRobbie H: Electronic cigarettes: review usage, content, safety, effects on smokers and potential harm and benefit. -To me the cartridges of the DSE-901 last me as for 3 4 sessions of vapeo of between 15 and 20 puffs each, but normally do not use cartridges, but drip directly into the atomizer (2 3 drops is equivalent to a session of Vapeo with this method). The topic is that after writing the post, rewrite it, see the comments of the people, look for articles, read opinions for against, etc etc I have it very clear. As nicotine nones have already been mentioned carcinogen, it is true that it is a poison but in large quantities and not in the quantities that are handled in the liquids of electronic cigarettes, also comment that like other poisons also used to cure treat some Diseases in this case the Alzheimer. The damage was done, I accidentally became a passive smoker and I did not realize until I began to feel the anxiety of the cigar when I had never smoked and then in this era dominated by technology and access to information I decided to take this path Instead of the habit of the cigar.</p>

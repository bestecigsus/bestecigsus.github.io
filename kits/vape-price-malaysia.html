A shame that a revolution more greet like the vape (with limits ... ) Has been spoiled so &#39;by who else would have been interested in its evolution ... By any case: after having smoked a packet and half a day of tobacco for 20 years, I can teach you my RX thoracic after 2 years and two months Of vapeo ... !!!! My doctor Has already become an activist provapeo !!!!!

I know people who have started with it and at the moment they are doing well, when they want to smoke they take the electronic cigarette and throw, in a short time they smoke half and they are improving. Log in. Another fact to be taken into account, 1 in 2 smokers will die from tobacco-related causes, every year 5 million people die from tobacco, and we do not count the diseases it causes ... I wanted to intervene with my personal experience in this subject, But seeing his arrogance &quot;and way of asserting his convictions&quot; of something he does not know I think it is not worth ... is just another sample of the campaigns orchestrated at any price, including ethics, for the demonization of something That good bad, that has yet to prove, it damages the interests of pharmaceutical patrons who see as the hen of the golden eggs &quot;are getting out of hand ... Congratulations !!! BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF PUERTO RICO: Low density also means that it does not accumulate in the heating element in the wicks as fast as in VG-rich e-liquids. The vapor also carries very small particles (ultra thin) that can affect health, these particles are of the same magnitudes as the smoke of tobacco, but in smaller quantity. (1) Other investigations have found in the vapor particles of tin, Silver and nickel, mainly; As well as iron, cerium, lanthanum, bismuth and zinc; This because the electronic cigars contain a resistance filament that is heated to vaporize the liquid (2). In addition to this, there is a concern of the specialists for the use of flavorings considered safe in food, but of which their potential health risk when being inhaled is unknown. Administrator. Timmons confessed to ignoring - until being interviewed by this newspaper - that the chemicals used in his device could contain other components such as nitrosamines, which can cause cancer.</p>

According to a recent report from a group of Democratic lawmakers, e-cigs manufacturers take advantage of a legal vacuum to promote their products to young people to make them addicted to nicotine. Use of electronic cigarettes in pregnancy. Okay, it is best not to smoke or vapear, but for people who smoke tobacco and can not quit it better to vapeen than to continue smoking tobacco, do not you think? The e-cigs are a boom in Spain, but in Latin America they have not had the same success. Imagine, take a shower and relax cup of Irish coffee. Available in: What is not the same is to stop entering by the face of a brutal way a little more than three euros per pack of tobacco in taxes that, if lords like that, millions of euros and it matters little here the health of the Spaniards, here it is only necessary to handle and handle with the abusive taxes of tobacco, hence the declared war on the vapeo without shame. This is not the case in France, where in May 2011 AFSSAPS (French Health Products Safety Agency) recommended not to consume them and two years later (in May 2013) it would be decided to apply the same rules as for cigarettes Conventional. The work, presented at the European Society of Respiratory Diseases (ERS) annual congress, held in Vienna on these days, is based on the nicotine carried by the device, a substance derived from tobacco, which despite being released through Of vapor, damages the airways. The amount of nicotine depends on the solution cartridge that is used; There are even nicotine-free solutions that are only flavored and are used by people who just want the rewarding sensory experience they get with tobacco but without the health risks. Human children are born too early compared to other animals: 9 months earlier in mobility and 18 months earlier in terms of bone development. It is most advisable to start with high-level nicotine fluids and after getting used to using the electronic cigarette it is advisable to gradually lower the levels of nicotine until you stop consuming it completely. In addition, studies have shown that they give off a higher percentage of toxic substances than tobacco for the rest of their lives. Since this &quot;harmless electronic cigarette&quot; also emits formaldehyde, acrolein, ethanal, tar, acetaldehyde, nickel, chromium and antimony ... only water vapor said ... ha ha .. .. beautiful marketing makeup without doubts but completely false .. reduce the smoke but increase the% of toxic substances you inhale and the addiction to tobacco is reduced but not Remove, since that is a totally psychological factor ... but hey, it is fashionable to say that &quot;they are healthy cigarettes&quot; and believe it apparently ...</p>
